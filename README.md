# Flux Operator

üößÔ∏è Under Construction! üößÔ∏è

This is currently a scaffolding that is having functionality added as @vsoch figures it out.
Come back and check later for updates! To work on this operator you should:

 - Have a recent version of Go installed (1.18.1)
 - Have minikube or kind installed
  
The sections below will describe:

 - [Organization](#organization) and design
 - [Quick Start](#quick-start) for using the operator
 - [Using the Operator](#using-the-operator): in more detail, as it is provided here
 - [Making the Operator](#making-the-operator): steps to initially create the operator

## Organization

The basic idea is that we have two controllers:

 - FluxJob: is a user facing job controller (meaning we have a CR, a simple yaml the user can provide an image and entrypoint)
 - FluxSetup: is more an internal or admin controller, meaning no CR, but there is a CRD (custom resource definition).
 
And you can find the following:

 - [Flux Controllers](controllers/flux) are under `controllers/flux` for each of `Flux` and `FluxSetup`
 - [API Spec](api/v1alpha1/) are under `api/v1alpha1/` also for each of `Flux` and `FluxSetup`
 - [Packages](pkg) include supporting packages for a flux manager and jobs, etc.
 - [TODO.md](TODO.md) is a set of TODOs @vsoch took notes on as she developed.


## Design

I am trying to mirror a design that is used by kueue, where the two controllers are aware of the state of the cluster via a third "manager" that can hold a queue of jobs. The assumption here is that the user is submitting jobs (FluxJob that will map to batchv1.Job) and the cluster (FluxSetup) has some max amount of room available, and we need those two things to be aware of one another. Currently the flow I'm working on is the following:

1. We create the FluxSetup
2. The Create event creates a queue (and asks for reconcile). 
  The reconcile needs to do some consolidation (not done yet) - it should always get the current number of running batch jobs and save to status and check against quota (TODO). Create should also eventually be able to manage cleaning up old setups to replace with new (in TODO). Right now we assume unlimited quota for the namespace, which of course isn't true!
3. A FluxJob is submit (e.g., by a user). Developer note: `make redo` submits the job after the original FluxSetup creation. 
4. The job is generally checked for status, and should be flagged as waiting and Create returns True. This will trigger the Job reconcile loop and the setup watcher.
4. The setup watches a channel with job updates, and this is connected to the jobHandler. The jobHandler is called only on a Generic event, and this is when the job needs to 

Some current additional notes:

1. FluxJob submit before the FluxSetup is ready are ignored. We don't have a Queue init yet to support them, and the assumption is that the user can re-submit.

## Quick Start

Know how this stuff works? Then here you go!

```bash
# Clone the source code
$ git clone https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-operator
$ cd flux-operator

# Start a minikube cluster
$ minikube start

# Make a flux operator namespace
$ kubectl create namespace flux-operator
namespace/flux-operator created

# Build the operator
$ make

# How to make your manifests
$ make manifests

# And install. This places an executable "bin/kustomize"
$ make install
```

There is also a courtesy function to clean, and apply the samples:

```bash
$ make clean  # remove old flux-operator namespaced items
$ make apply  # apply the setup and job config
$ make run    # run the cluster
$ make job    # submit a job
```

or run all three for easy development! The below command ensures to submit a job after the FluxSetup is applied so it won't be ignored (jobs submit before there is a cluster setup are ignored and require the user to re-submit).

```bash
$ make redo  # clean, apply, and run
```
And then submit your job in a different terminal

```bash
$ make job
```

## Using the Operator

If you aren't starting from scratch, then you can use the code here to see how things work!

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-operator
$ cd flux-operator
```

### 1. Start a Cluster

First, start a cluster with minikube:

```bash
$ minikube start
```

And make a flux operator namespace

```bash
$ kubectl create namespace flux-operator
namespace/flux-operator created
```

You can set this namespace to be the default (if you don't want to enter `-n flux-operator` for future commands:

```bash
$ kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=flux-operator
```

If you haven't ever installed minkube, you can see [install instructions here](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).

### 2. Build

And then officially build.

```bash
$ make
```

To make your manifests:

```bash
$ make manifests
```

And install. Note that this places an executable [bin/kustomize](bin/kustomize) that you'll need to delete first if you make install again.

```bash
$ make install
```

### 3. Cleanup

When cleaning up, you can control+c to kill the operator from running, and then:

```bash
$ kubectl delete pod --all
$ kubectl delete svc --all
```
And one of the following:

```bash
$ minikube stop
```

## Making the operator

This section will walk through some of the steps that @vsoch took to create the controller using the operator-sdk, and challenges she faced.

### 1. Installation

First, [install the operator-sdk](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/installation/) for your platform.
At the end of this procedure it should be on your path.
At the

```bash
$ which operator-sdk
/usr/local/bin/operator-sdk
```

### 2. Start A Development Cluster

You can either use [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/):

```bash
$ minikube start

# or for the first time
$ minikube start init
```

### 3. Local Workspace

At this point, I made sure I was in this present working directory, and I created
a new (v2) module and then "init" the operator:

```bash
$ go mod init flux-framework/flux-operator
$ operator-sdk init
```

Note that you don't need to do this, obviously, if you are using the existing operator here!

### 4. Create Controller

Now let's create a controller, and call it Flux (again, no need to do this if you are using the one here).

```bash
$ operator-sdk create api --version=v1alpha1 --kind=Flux
```
(say yes to create a resource and controller). Make sure to install all dependencies (I think this might not be necessary - I saw it happen when I ran the previous command).

```bash
$ go mod tidy
$ go mod vendor
```

At this point I chat with Eduardo about operator design, and we decided to go for a simple design:

- Flux: would have a CR that defines a job and exposes an entrypoint command / container to the user
- FluxSetup would have most of the content of [here](https://lc.llnl.gov/confluence/display/HFMCCEL/Flux+Operator+Design) and be more of an internal or admin setup.

To generate FluxSetup I think I could (maybe?) have run this command again, but instead I added a new entry to the [PROJECT](PROJECT) and then generated [api/v1alpha1/fluxsetup_types.go](api/v1alpha1/fluxsetup_types.go) from the `flux_types.go` (and changing all the references from Flux to FluxSetup). 
I also needed to (manually) make [controllers/fluxsetup_controller.go](controllers/fluxsetup_controller.go) and ensure it was updated to use FluxSetup, and then adding
it's creation to [main.go](main.go). Yes, this is a bit of manual work, but I think I'll only need to do it once.
At this point, I needed to try and represent what I saw in the various config files in this types file.

**under development**

And then see the instructions above for [using the operator](#using-the-operator).

### 5. Debugging Yaml

Since many configs are created in the operator, I always write them out in yaml to the [yaml](yaml)
directory. We can remove these bits of the code after we are done. I also found the following debugging commands useful:

```bash
# Why didn't my statefulset create?
kubectl describe -n flux-operator statefulset
```

## Useful Resources

I found the following resources really useful:

 - [RedHat OpenShift API Spec](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/rest_api/objects/index.html#objectmeta-meta-v1) for digging into layers of objects
 - [Kubernetes API](https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/2f9e58849198f8675bc0928c69acf7e50af77551/apps/v1/types.go): top level folders apps/core/batch useful!

## Troubleshooting

To view a resource (in the flux-operator namespace):

```bash
$ kubectl --namespace flux-operator get pods
```

I found this helpful for debugging the stateful set - e.g., it was stuck on ContainerCreating:

```bash
$ kubectl describe -n flux-operator pods
```

If you need to clean things up (ensuring you only have this one pod and service running first) I've found it easier to do:

```bash
$ kubectl delete pod --all

# Service shorthand
$ kubectl delete svc --all
$ kubectl delete statefulset --all

# ConfigMap shorthand
$ kubectl delete cm --all
```

One time I messed something up and my metrics server was still running (and I couldn't start again) and I killed it like this:

```bash
$ kill $(lsof -t -i:8080)
```

If you see:

```bash
1.6605195805812113e+09	ERROR	controller-runtime.source	if kind is a CRD, it should be installed before calling Start	{"kind": "Flux.flux-framework.org", "error": "no matches for kind \"Flux\" in version \"flux-framework.org/v1alpha1\""}
```

You need to remove the previous kustomize and install the CRD again:

```bash
$ rm bin/kustomize
$ make install
```

If your resource (config/samples) don't seem to be taking, remember you need to apply them for changes to take
effect:

```bash
$ bin/kustomize build config/samples | kubectl apply -f -
```

Also remember since we are providing the instance as a reference (`&instance`) to get the fields from that
you need to do:

```go
(*instance).Spec.Field
```
Otherwise it shows up as an empty string.

This work is heavily inspired from [kueue](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue) for the design. I am totally new to operator design and tried
several basic designs, and decided to mimic this setup (a simplified version) for a first shot, and for my own learning. kueue at the time of
this was also under the [Apache-2.0](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue/blob/ec9b75eaadb5c78dab919d8ea6055d33b2eb09a2/LICENSE) license.
